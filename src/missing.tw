    Lead detective: Detecive Brooke Pottinger 
    Time frame: early fall '98 
    Victims: Sunny Cao (10), Paul Keeley (10), Delilah Watts (10)
    - Note: It is unknown at this time whether some of the other murders that happened this summer are related to this case or not. 

    Cao's, Keeley's, and Watts's bodies were found inside three different arcade cabinets at the back of Spirit Cell Arcade after they had been missing for four days, eight days, and fifteen days respectively. All three were determined to have died from cyanide poisoning prior to their bodies being placed in the cabinets. The last person to work on the cabinets was Archibald Watts, who denies any connection to the murder. 

    No further leads have been found at this time. It is impossible for the investigation to proceed from here.

    Archibald Watts was the prime suspect in the killing spree that took place in '98, but was ultimately never convicted due to a lack of non-circumstantial evidence. The town seems to believe that he was the killer and doesn't seem to have forgiven him.

After living in seclusion for a few years, he decided to continue working and took on a couple of part-time jobs: doing maintenance work at the Lucy Lemon in town and teaching shop classes at Edenvale College, the local community college. His students say that he's tough on grading, but that his life stories and skill at teaching make the class worth it.

    The minute you woke up you were bombarded with text messages, missed calls, and news reports of the fire that took place about an hour away from your apartment. You had replied to the most pressing messages and briefly glanced through the news reports. You wish you'd studied them a bit more carefully now. Maybe then you'd know why the mood in the police station was so… weird. 
    
    You set your stuff down at your desk and lean over to your partner's desk. "Hey Mark, what's up with everyone today? Feels like there's a surprise party planned and I'm the only one out of the loop."

    Mark gives you a quick wave before focusing back on his laptop. "Didn't you hear? The Watts place burned down." 

    So that's where the fire was. "Right, yeah, the Watts place… Oh." 

    Mark nods. "Yeah, oh. I'm surprised it took so long for it to click for you." 

    "Hey, in my defense I-"

    You look up for the source of the shout and see Captain Pottinger standing in the doorway to her office. She looks vaguely annoyed, like someone get her coffee order wrong. "Come over here. I need to talk to you for a second." 

    As she walks back into her office, you glance at Mark. He grins and teasingly whispers, "Oooooh, someone's in trouble."

    "Bold words from the idiot who was called into her office last week because of the amount of coffee stains on his report." 

    Mark rolls his eyes at you and turns back to his work. "Yeah, yeah. Better get in there before Pottinger blows a fuse." 

    "Aye-aye, sir." You jokingly salute him and walk over to the office.

    As you knock on the door to Captain Pottinger's office, you feel yourself getting a bit nervous. You desperately try to remember anything that happened within the past week that could possibly get you written up. Nothing comes to mind, but it doesn't shake the uneasy feeling pooling in your gut. "Captain. It's Detective $lname."

    "Come in."

    You open the door and walk into the office. 

    Captain Pottinger is sitting behind the large desk in the room and seems to be reading a paper when you walk in. When you close the door, she closes the file and looks at you, gesturing for you to take a seat on one of the chairs in front of her desk. 

    You sit down. "Everything alright, Captain?"

    She folds her hands and stares at you over the table. "Everything is dandy on my end, $lname. I was out of town at county-wide police chief meeting until 6AM today when I was called back to the station, so I'm a bit tired, but that's neither here nor there. Do you know why I called you into my office?"

    "Captain, if this is about the rubber ducks by the coffee machine, I really don't know anything about them. They just appeared one day in the break room and they've really been spelling out everyone's names at this point so my name being first one that was spelled really doesn't..."

    Captain Pottinger raises her hand for you to stop talking. "That's not it. Though I will take that into consideration." 
    
    You die a little bit inside. 

    "No, I called you in because of this." She slides the file she was reading earlier across the desk to you.

    You pick up the file and open it. Inside is a typed report and several photos. Most of the photos are of the open cabinets of arcade machines with bundles of clothes inside. You take a closer look and realize those bundles are children, curled up and shoved into the machine. "This is..." 

    "This is the report from the serial killings of '98. I think you'll find it useful in your investigations." 

    You look up, confused. "My investigations? I'm not assigned to any case right now, Captain."

    "You are now." Captain Pottinger slides another file across her desk to you. "Your new assignment is to investigate the murder of Archibald Watts."

    "It did. And then his charred body was found in the Lucy Lemon off Dalby Road. The techs are still out at both locations doing their preliminary investigations. Any questions?"

    "Why me? This feels like a case that would usually be assigned to someone a bit more senior." Even though you were a detective, there were plenty of other detectives that had more experience than you. 

    Captain Pottinger leans back in her chair and looks up at the ceiling. "When did you move to Los Oso, $name?" 
    
    You don't have to think long. "My junior year of high school. The summer of '05."

    "Do you know how long every other detective has lived in Los Oso?"

    You genuinely don't know how to respond to that.

    Captain Pottinger looks tired, like she aged 10 years in the ten seconds it took her to lean back in her chair. "We've all lived here longer than you. Not a single one of us is not connected to someone who died that year."
    
    You keep quiet. You sense that rushing answers from the captain would be a bad idea right now. 

    After a long silence, Captain Pottinger sits up again and looks at you. Her exhaustion is again hidden behind her usual indifferent expression. "Any other questions?"

    "No one. You'll be leading this case on your own. You'll be working with the usual CSI team because we never have enough of them to spare in the first place, and you can ask some patrol officers to help you out at your own discretion, but other than that you're on your own."

    "Captain, with all due respect, this doesn't feel like enough support." Usually teams consisted of two or more detectives, working with a team of police officers to cover the ground they needed to. Working a case on your own felt more than a little daunting. 

    Captain Pottinger just shrugs. "Unfortunately, you have to work this one by yourself. There aren't any other detectives who can help you."

    You turn around again to face the captain. "Yes?"

    The captain is looking at the stack of files in her inbox, but is still clearly addressing you. "If you don't manage to find the killer... Let's just say that no one in this city will hold it against you."

    In an attempt to break the awkward silence, you cough and wave the files. "Anyways, I'll probably be in the field most of today. Two crime scene to cover and only one of me so..." 

	"Yeah, sure. Don't let me keep you. Let me know if you need any help." Mark's usually laid-back and cheerful demeanor is absent, replaced by something much quieter and contemplative.

    "Hah, yeah." Lying to Mark makes you feel a bit guilty, but you know that if you told him the truth that he'd take it pretty badly. "Anyways, I'm gonna head over to the archives, see if I can't get a bit more information than what's in here." You wave the case file in your hand.

    The block is lined with cars parked almost end to end. Most of them seem to belong to the houses they're parking in front of, but you have a feeling more than a few of them belong to reporters trying to get the scoop of what's going on. Miraculously finding an open spot, you park at the end of the block and grab your notebook from the cup holder where you'd placed it earlier. You dodge around the reporters gathered around the area as you make your way to the house. As you approach the crime scene tape, you pull out your badge to show to one of the officers on the scene who lets you through.

    You and Vera had both moved to Los Oso during high school and became fast friends. Her quick wit and surprisingly insightful analysis of the texts assigned in English class were fun to listen to and even more fun to debate with. You were surprised when she went into science rather than literature, but whenever you asked she just shrugged and said that science was her first love. 
    
    Vera shrugs. "No better than the last time you saw me $name. Still hanging around crime scenes like my job depends on it. Oh wait."

    You nod as you pull on the gloves. "Fair enough." 
    
    The two of you enter the house. The inside is pretty much what you would expect from a house that barely survived a fire. You can barely make out the original color of the walls. Any curtains or rugs that may have been in the house before have been burned to ash. The wooden furniture is badly charred.

    Vera passes you an evidence bag with a silver lighter inside. "We found it in the driveway."
    
    You study the lighter carefully. It's the kind you need to flip the cap open in order to use, probably used often by the amount of wear and tear you can see on the casing. On one side of the casing, there's a sideways M, or is it a W?

I'll let you know if we find anything, but so far it looks like random junk: empty arcade cabinets, old bike frames, random stacks of playing cards, anything you can think of.

The attached bathroom seems to have come away a bit better, but only because most of it is tile and ceramic. The ceiling still has evidence of the fire and the walls and mirror are covered with soot. 

    Vera gestures around the room. "Somehow, this room is the only room worse off than the kitchen. We expected it to be the living room since it's attached, but the bedroom is even worse off. My current thought process is that there was a source of fire up here that's been burnt to ashes, but that only works if there was someone in the house at the time. Otherwise, there wouldn't be any way for there to be two sources of fire."

    You do the math in your head. "Yeah, 8 years old."

    "Has anyone found a key? Or maybe a very very tiny and long gear?"
	
    Vera looks up in thought. "Key... gear... No, I don't think so... Ah, wait." She shoves her phone back in her pocket and runs over to one of the CSIs. You can see her gesture to something and the CSI handing her something. She walks back over to you and hands you a small evidence baggie. "We found this in the driveway. It's the closest I can think of." 
	
    You take the baggie and study the item inside. It looks like a tiny ice pick, but there are curves and ridges on the side similar to an old hand-crank pencil sharpener. "Can I take this?" 
	
    Vera squints at you. "We haven't fingerprinted it yet or anything. Can you wait until we at least catalog it?" 
	
    "When will that be?" 
	
    "Give me a few minutes and then it's yours. Or, it's yours until we leave." 
	
    "Deal." You hand the bag to Vera. "Can you meet me in the backyard when you're done?"

    You take a walk around the perimeter. 
	
    The outside of the house is just as flame-ridden as you'd expect. The once-light-grey paint charred black from the fire with scorch marks extremely evident around the windows. The fire didn't spread to the grass outside the house thanks to the brick walkway that surrounds the house. It's a good thing the fire department got there before the fire spread to the neighbors' houses. You don't want to think about the casualties that could have resulted from that. 
	
    You enter the backyard and see a shed on the far side of the backyard.

    You look behind you to see Vera walking up. She hands you the bag with the key in it. "Make sure to wear your gloves while handling it." 
	
    You waggle your already-gloved hands in her face and she makes a face and pushes them aside. You snicker and turn back around to unlock the door to the shed. 
	
    You try to stick the key in the lock, but realize that the sides of the key are all slightly different widths, and that the key needs to be put in a specific way. It takes you a few tries, but you eventually figure out the correct orientation for the key.

    When you open the door, you realize the shed is actually a workshop.
    
    <<link "Next">><<goto "Day 1 Investigate 02a09b01a01">><</link>><<else>>You walk over to the shed and notice that it's in much better shape than you'd expect.

The keyhole looks like a gear shape, nowhere near a regular key. You'll have to see if anyone found the key.

The first table has several electronic devices carelessly placed on it, each one with a note taped to it. You recognize a few video game consoles from your childhood. The other table has a set of tools carefully placed in an organizer leaning against the wall. There's an open laptop lying on the bench.

    There are several small screwdrivers, tweezers, and wrenches in a tool organizer leaning against the wall. There's an unplugged soldering iron in its station on the table. Also on the table is an open laptop and a note with a name and an address. You try turning the laptop on but nothing happens. Looks like it's either dead or broken. Either way, you won't be getting any information from it until one of the CSIs can take a look at it. You jot down the name and address just in case. 
    
    There's a drawer in the table. Opening it reveals several electronic components that you can't make heads or tails of. You take photos of them anyways, hoping inspiration might strike later.

    Vera nods. "Okay. Stay out of trouble."

A small air freshener hangs on the rearview mirror, but the lack of smell suggests that whoever put it there just never replaced it. There's nothing on the side compartments or in the back.

    It's a gas stove like Vera told you earlier. The working theory is that someone left the gas on and then lit a flame that set the whole house on fire.

    You try your best to put the drawer back in when a CSI walks into the room. Both of you look at each other for a second, frozen in place. Eventually the CSI gestures to the drawer and awkwardly says, "I can, uh, I can take that if you want."

    You had met Nicholas when he was a new recruit to the CSI team and you were a police officer. He had the sense of humor of a 13 year-old (and sometimes had the same amount of sense as one), but he did his job so you can't really say anything too bad about him. With a mouth that talked a mile a minute and a brain that could discern a person's biggest insecurity in half that time, he was a formidable force to deal with. The two of you have a mutual understanding that he never mentions how bad you are at first-person shooter games and you never mention the time he threw up in your car during a car chase.

But yeah, that's where we found old man Watts. All slumped over, dried blood on his chest, probably from the who-knows-how-many stab wounds he had. I mean the coroner's office will know but like man I'm pretty sure Dr. Liang hates my guts so..." 
	
    You tune out Nicholas's rambling about how much the chief medical examiner supposedly hates him and walk over to the arcade machine. The CSI team had marked where Archibald Watts's legs were splayed out on the stage, but the inside of the arcade machine was unmarked. Seems like Watts wasn't a very tall man, which matched what you remembered of him. You crouch down and take a good look inside the machine.

    "...and I thought she'd appreciate my efforts but I guess frogs just aren't her thing, who knew-" Nicholas stops talking as you stand back up abruptly. "What's up?" 
	
    "Aren't you going to finish telling me about the case?" You turn to face him.  
	
    "But I did." 
	
    "No, all you told me was you found ashy footprints and the arcade machine. What else is there?" 
	
    "I told you about the body too."

    Nicholas deflates slightly. He rubs the back of his neck with his hand and stares at the curtains behind the stage. "Well, there's honestly not much else. None of the machines were on when we got here, we can't exactly do luminol testing here because, well, it's a Lucy Lemon. Kids spit and pee and bleed all over this place basically 24/7, and the custodians don't get paid enough to clean that shit up. 
    
    "And don't even think of asking us to fingerprint those arcade machines. We already tried a few and there are so many overlapping and smudged prints that there might as well not be anything at all. We didn't find anything in any of the trashcans either. No knife, no bloody tablecloth, no nothing." 
    
    As he spoke, Nicholas became more and more animated until he got to the point where he was waving his arms in the air agitatedly. He then suddenly froze and pointed at you. "Did I say anything about the cigarette butts?" 
	
    You lower your hands which you'd raised when he'd suddenly pointed his finger at you. "No?" 
	
    "Ah, well we found those. Some outside the back door, others inside the storage area behind the stage. We'd probably be able to get a DNA profile off of those but other than the criminal DNA database we don't have any suspects to compare that to. And it's just as likely it's an employee who didn't clean up after their smoke break. But figured I'd at least mention it. But other than that I think I've mentioned everything."

    Nicholas walks over to the machine and runs his gloved hand over the top of it. "There was nothing on it. No fingerprints, no glove prints, no ear prints, no prints to speak of.

My sister's been breathing down my neck trying to get me to visit so I can 'finally visit my new niece' but I'm so tired of trying to play nice with her husband that I'm almost glad for the case to give me an excuse to put off going for a little longer.

    You sigh. "Yeah, other than that." 
			
    "Nope. I know he used to work at Spirit Cell Arcade back before the Lucy Lemon was built on top of it, but that's because- fun fact!- I found that out when looking for a decent arcade around here. Spirit Cell was the last big one before it went out of business." Nicholas shrugs. "I think I heard Watts had an eBay store for fixed up game consoles, but I'm more of a modern games man so I never went looking. Besides, not sure I wouldn't trust him to not kill me if we met up to do a sale."

    "So it was broken before the crime took place?"

    "Well, bug activity shows that the body's been dead for less than a day in regular conditions. Unless the killer stored his body in a freezer or something I think we can safely say that yeah it was before Watts was killed."

    As you walk out the back door, you notice the bright yellow sign next to the door, likely marking where the cigarette butts were found. You slowly walk around the building, but don't find anything of note. As you approach the front, you see the police officers attempting to ward off a hoard of reporters. Behind them, you can see news vans parked up and down the street, unable to access the parking lot. 
		
    One reporter spots you and starts yelling, asking if you had anything to say about the case. You shield your face from the cameras and turn around. Best not to talk to the press until you have something to say other than "no comment."

    "Oh damn what's that?" Nicholas had walked onto the stage without you noticing and peaks over your shoulder. 

    "Not sure, but I think it's a scrunchie."

    Nicholas crouches down and squints at the scrunchie. "Can't tell how long it's been down there. I'll catalog this and let you know."

    The monitor, joystick, and buttons have been removed, leaving only the empty cabinet behind. You check the side and see that it was originally a PACMAN game. It probably won't be operational any time soon. 
	
    You check where the body was sitting. As you noticed before, there's no bloodstains on the inside of the cabinet. You try to imagine what the body must have looked like in there when a sudden chill runs down your spine.

The stars of the show- Oliver Orange, Lance Lime, Gary Grapefruit, and of course Lucy Lemon herself- stand motionless behind the curtain.

    Behind it is a windowless room that matches what Nicholas had described earlier. Tools hang on one wall, a stack of drawers with labels cover another, and animatronic body parts decorate the third. The floor has several yellow evidence markers, which is probably where the cigarette butts were found. 

    You take a closer look at the drawers. The plastic drawers are of varying sizes. The ones at the bottom come up to your knee and you can see a few at the top that look no larger than the height of a milk carton. 
	
    You try to read some of the labels on the drawers closest to you. "Bouncy balls." "Rings." "Frisbees." "Finger traps." These were all prizes, probably the extras that weren't stored at the front. You take a peek inside the one labeled "bouncy balls" and confirm that there are indeed several bouncy balls inside, enough that the tub is almost full. The bright colors and designs swirl before your eyes. You suppress the urge to grab one and see if it works.

    The base of the switch is still attached to the wall but the actual lever is lying on the floor, snapped clean off the wall. 

    You bend down to look at the lever. One end of the lever has a grip on it and the other is jagged. You decide not to touch it in case they haven't fingerprinted it yet. 

    You check the part still on the wall. It's coated in a thick layer of dust, enough to make you- oh no. "ACHOOO." You sneeze and blow away a layer of dust. One of the CSIs behind you starts sobbing. Oops. 
    
    Upon closer inspection, you realize that there's a small latch beside the lever base. You use the tip of your pen to undo the latch, revealing a button that reads "EMERGENCY UNLOCK." <<if $optional_evidence["panels"]>>That sounds appropriate. <</if>>You click it.

    All the machines are shut down. Their usual flashing lights and loud sounds are absent, replaced with dim screens and silence. Instead of children running around and shrieking, you see a small group of CSIs examining the area, talking to each other as they dust powders and take photos. You aren't quite sure what they're doing, but figure you'll figure it out from their report later. 
	
    You wander for a bit and glace at the machine next to you. It's a pinball machine with a zombies theme, the kind you'd expect ghoulish screams to come from every time you light up a section. Rather morbid for a family entertainment center, but you figure that maybe it was for the older kids who got dragged here by family to play.

    You decide to leave the Lucy Lemon. 

    <<if $optional_evidence["scrunchie"]>>You walk over to the back of the stage where Nicholas is setting up some evidence markers, camera sitting next to him. "Hey Nicholas, I'm heading out."

    He turns around, an exaggerated frown on his face. "Oh so now that you've given me more work you get to leave? Thanks a lot."

    You roll your eyes. "You should have just found the emergency latch earlier. Sounds like a skill issue."

    He punches your leg from where he's sitting. "Get out of here."

    You laugh and walk away. "Alright, see ya later."
    <<else>>You walk over to where Nicholas is still leaning on the wall, scrolling through his phone. You wave your hand in front of his face. "I'm heading out."

    He bats your hand out of the air and turns his phone off. "Finally! Means we can go home too." 

    You laugh. "Sorry for keeping y'all here."

    Nicholas waves his hand through the air. "Nah, it's our jobs. I'm just ready to go sleep though."

    You raise your eyebrow. "It's only <<if $time == 1>>morning<<elseif $time == 2>>afternoon<<else>>evening<</if>>."

    Nicholas shrugs and walks to the empty space where the front door used to be. "Any time is a good time to take a nap."

    The day took more out of you than you'd care to admit. Deciding that leftovers sound fine, you grab a container from the fridge and throw it in the microwave. As you wait for the food to heat up, you open your laptop, figuring you could unwind by watching a movie or something. Unfortunately for you, the last page you had been on was the local news, meaning the minute you open your browser you're greeted with a rerun of this afternoon's broadcast. 

    The screen is split between a newscaster and an on-the-ground reporter. Looking closely at the reporter's background, you can see a blurry yellow sign. The sign looks like the one that's above the entrance to... You wonder if this was about your case.

    Almost as if to confirm your thoughts, the newscaster began talking. "This afternoon, we have updates on the fire that claimed the house of Archibald Watts. At 2:45AM this morning, a Archibald Watts's son Adam Watts called 911 saying that his father's house was on fire. The fire department quickly arrived on the scene and were able to put out the blaze before it spread to its neighbors. 

    "Adam Watts, who had arrived in town an hour prior, says he had swung by the house to see if his father was still awake. When he got there, the house was already starting to burn. He ran in to check if anyone was in there, but had to exit the house because the fire was too unbearable. Authorities confirmed that they didn't find anyone inside the house. 

    "The older Watt's location had been a mystery until this morning when his body was found in a Lucy Lemon Family Entertainment Center. Natalie, what can you tell us about the current situation?" 

    Ah, so it is about your case. 

    <<link "Next">><<goto "Day 1 Outro 03">><</link>>
    
:: Day 1 Outro 03 {"position":"4450,525"}
    The reporter responds in a grim tone. "Well Fredrick, the authorities have not been very forthcoming with how the investigation is going, so we know very little. All we know right now is that Archibald Watts was found dead in the Lucy Lemon that you can see behind me." At this she gestures to the building behind her and for a brief moment the camera shifts its focus to the giant lemon sign on the roof.

    The reporter continues talking as the camera shifts back to focus on her. "A worker came in to do pre-opening maintenance work on the animatronics and apparently found Archibald Watts's body inside, causing him to call 911. When the authorities arrived, they determined that Archibald Watts was dead and declared the building a crime scene. As a result, this Lucy Lemon will not be operational until investigations wrap up and the building can be completely disinfected. 
    
    "We are waiting for further news from the investigative team, but because this case involves an individual tied so closely to Los Oso's history, it seems like the authorities are waiting to have a more complete idea of what happened before they present it to the public. However, they are asking anyone with information to contact them either through the police website or by phone to their tip line. Back to you Frederick." 

    The newscaster nods and the screen shifts to push the reporter's view out and focus again on the newscaster. "Thank you for your work Natalie. In a public statement, Lucy Lemon management has apologized for the inconvenience and is asking parents who had reservations to reach out to them so that they can either arrange a different date for their celebration or begin the refund process."

    You pause the video and close the tab. The grim reminder that you're now under the public eye more than you ever have been before scares you, but makes you a bit more determined to complete this job to the best of your ablility. There's too much riding on this for you to mess it up. 

    You remember your food and grab it from the microwave. It's still hot but you decide you're too hungry to care. You put the plate next to your laptop and pull up your work email. In your inbox sit three emails: one from Vera, one from Nicholas, and one from the coroner's office. As you start eating, you click on the emails one by one.

    In it, she details what the team has cataloged so far from <<if $optional_evidence["trailer"]>>the various upstairs rooms, the shed, and the garage<<else>>the various upstairs rooms and the shed<</if>>. The amount of items is slightly overwhelming, so you scroll to the end of the email in hopes of something other than a video game console name. At the very end, Vera mentions that her crew found traces of tobacco around the house, so the cause of the fire could very well be a cigarette. If that was the case, then that meant there was someone in or near the house when the fire started. 

    At the end of the email she reminds you of that drink you owe her and attaches an image. You open the attachment to find a very shaky photograph of Vera's three bulldogs all trying to jump at the camera, giant smiles on their faces. 

    You make a note of these new observations and save the image to your Camera Roll.

    At the top of it is what looks like a large black arc. As you scroll, you realize it's just a really big image of a zero. You can almost hear him laughing at you. 
    
    You scroll a bit faster and finally reach the bulk of the email. In it, Nicholas tells you that his team ultimately didn't find a murder weapon or anything like that in the building. They've got a DNA profile on the cigarette butts but no match in the criminal database. There was also one unsmoked cigarette left outside the back door, but there's also no match for the DNA on that one either. <<if $optional_evidence["scrunchie"]>>He also mentions that the scrunchie you found inside the stage looks pretty old, but there isn't any dust on the top to suggest that it had been there for very long. Apparently it had a hidden zipper and pocket inside which in turn contained several very old candies, an arcade coin, and a blue ribbon. <<elseif $optional_evidence["lever"]>>He also mentions that the button you clicked caused the panels on the stage to pop up, and they found a pink scrunchie inside.

    They also note that there was evidence that Watts's body was moved frequently until he died, and that his final resting position was sitting upright but leaning backwards against something. <<if $optional_evidence["lighter"]>> 

    In response to a message you had sent prior, the coroner also wrote that Watts's lungs didn't look like those of a heavy smoker, so if he smoked he didn't do it very often. <</if>>

    After you finish reading the emails, you take a break from your laptop and finish eating your food. As you eat, you try to organize everything you just read in your brain. Unknown DNA, cigarettes, stab wounds... Seems this case is more complicated than you initially thought. 
    
    Unbidden, Pottinger's voice floats through your mind, reminding you that Los Oso won't be worse off if you fail to catch the killer. Finally at a place where you can breath, you mull that over for a few minutes. If Watts really killed that many kids, would it be a good thing for his killer to go free? Maybe this is one time you could just let the murderer go?
    
    You shake your head. What are you thinking? When you joined the police force you made an oath to uphold the values of your community, and that includes making sure murderers don't walk free. Letting this person go would go against what you stand for. Hopefully a good night's sleep will allow you to organize your thoughts.

As you stare up at your bedroom ceiling, you regret reviewing the report the captain gave you before you went to sleep. You had a hard time sleeping because of it, waking up every so often from dreams of being locked in a dark room that was slowly closing in on you with no way out. 

    Your cat Molly who would oh so lovingly lie on your face in the middle of the night also wasn't helping things.

Others are death threats, telling you that the person who killed Watts is twice the person you or any officer is for finally bringing Watts to justice. 

    Only a few of the messages actually have tips. One of them says that they saw a $markCar following Watts's truck to his house the afternoon before the fire. Another says that they saw a $adamCar driving up and down the street a few hours before the fire. The last one says that they saw Watts's truck leave the estate and arrive back a few hours before the fire. None of them have exact times, but you file these away for later.

    You glance at the time as you pass the clock on the wall and see that it's only 9:52AM. You debate with yourself slightly and decide that you deserve a treat. As you approach the drinks area, you see that the ducks by the coffee machine have been rearranged.

I'm off-duty and I can't arrest the guy for hanging around a school, so my hands are a bit tied. But my gut was telling me that he was up to something. So I asked one of Ashley's friend's moms if she could hang around for a bit and, if I wasn't back in ten minutes, if she wouldn't mind taking Ashley home with them for the afternoon. She agreed, and so I followed Watts." 
    
    "He got in his car after a couple minutes, so I trailed him in mine. It looks like my gut was wrong on this one because he didn't do much, just went home. I didn't hang around to see if he'd go out again though- I'm not stalking the guy- I just wanted to be sure he didn't kidnap a kid.

    Mark resumes working at his desk, and you take that as your cue to do the same. You flip to the page you were writing on earlier titled, "Interviewees." The page has two names written on it: Adam Watts and Khanh Cao. Adam Watts was the one who reported the house burning, and Khanh Cao was the one who found the body, so it made sense to interview both of them.

    There were some points you wanted to follow up with him on. You knew that you probably wouldn't be able to catch him before he left the office, but maybe you could talk to him later this evening. You lean over to Mark and tap him on the shoulder. "Hey, can I ask you some stuff about the Watts case?"

    Mark looks back at you. "Yeah, sure. Now?"

    You shake your head. "Nah, probably some time this evening. I've got a couple people I need to ask first. I know you're heading out early, but I figured I could swing by your place this evening."

    Mark mulls it over for a minute before nodding. "Sure. Fred and Ashley would love to see you too. Come over around 8PM; we should be done with dinner by then. "

    You nod and jot that down. "Sounds good. Thanks man."

Luckily, both emails were concise and to-the-point, listing facts you'd heard from Vera and Nicholas. At the bottom of the email about the Watts house was Adam Watts's phone number and current address, with a note that Watts was renting an AirBnB, and at the bottom of the email about the Lucy Lemon was Khanh Cao's phone number and current address.

    Adam grabs the card, but says nothing. It doesn't look like he'll say anything else at this point. 

    You walk him out of the station. He doesn't look back as he quickly walks to what you assume is his car. You note that he drives a $adamCar.

    "Yep, you're free to go. Here's my card in case you remember anything or you need to reach me for any reason." 

    Adam hastily grabs the card and shoves it in his pocket. "Thanks Detective." 

    "No worries. Let's get you out of here, shall we?" You stand up and open the door for Adam, who quickly walks through it. You walk him to the front of the station and watch as he gives you a grateful nod (which you return) and then speed walks to his car. You note that he drives a $adamCar.

    You check the clock and see that it's a little past 1PM. You have some time to kill before you can call Khanh Cao back. As you wonder what to do, you feel your stomach rumble. Realizing you haven't eaten since breakfast, you decide a quick meal is probably in order. You quickly walk back to your desk and, after some deliberation, decide on the sandwich shop walking distance from the station. You put a little "Out to Lunch" note on your desk and make a beeline for the door. 

    <<link "Next">><<goto "Day 2 Interview 09">><</link>>

:: Day 2 Interview 09 {"position":"5400,1900"}
    When you arrive at the shop, the worker behind the counter greets you with a smile. "$name! How's it going?" 

    You've visited here enough times for most of the lunchtime staff to know your name, and for you to know most of theirs. "Going alright, Monica. Just stopping by for lunch." You order your usual sandwich and Monica rings you up. It feels a bit odd ordering just for yourself when Mark's not there, but you figure he's probably left the station by now to make it to his daughter's school on time so you don't order him a sandwich. 

    <<link "Next">><<goto "Day 2 Interview 10">><</link>>

:: Day 2 Interview 10 {"position":"5400,2025"}
    One sandwich and a full belly later, you walk back to the station. The late autumn afternoon sun feels nice on your walk, and you try your best to savor it before you enter the land of unforgiving LEDs once more. 
    
    About halfway back to the station, a quiet voice in the back of your brain that sounds oddly like Mark says that if Archibald Watts was such a bad person, maybe him being dead wasn't so bad after all. Maybe there were people who deserved to die. You shake your head and try to ignore the voice as you continue your walk. If the air is a little colder and your strides a little faster, that's nobody's business but yours. 
    
    As you enter the building, you check your phone and note that it's a few minutes before three. You set your stuff back down at your desk and dial Khanh Cao's number. You wait on the line only to get sent to voicemail. After checking the clock (it's now 3:01PM), you leave a voicemail asking him to call you back at his earliest convenience. Less than five minutes later, you get a call back from him. 

    "Hello, Detective $lname speaking." 

    "Detective, this is Khanh Cao." 

    "Thank you for calling me back, Professor Cao. Is now a good time to speak to you?" 

    "Yes. That's why I called you back." He doesn't seem to be the type to beat around the bush. 

    "Thank you for doing so. If you wouldn't mind, I have a few questions to ask you about Archibald Watts. Would you be available to meet later today?" 

    "My classes are finished for today. Come by Edenvale College. My office is ML413." 

    You jot down that information. "When would you like to meet?" 

    "Didn't you say some time today? Just get here before 6PM. I want to go home before dinner." 

    You quickly pull up Edenvale College on the maps app. Talking to Cao felt like being grilled by Pottinger after a case gone wrong. "Understood. In that case I can be there in about half an hour." 

    "That's fine. See you then, Detective." 

    "See-" *click* You stop for a second as you realize you've been hung up on. What is it with this man and ending calls so abruptly? You shake your head and grab your stuff once more. Hopefully you'll figure that out when you meet him.

    The drive thankfully doesn't take a full half hour. Tracking down Cao's office, however, takes much longer than you thought it would. Ten minutes past your promised hour, you find your way to the back of the campus where a tall building sits. You quickly enter through the door closest to you and jog down the long hallway, glancing at the numbers next to the doors. 

    402, 404, 40- you quickly notice these offices are all even numbers. Frantically, you look between the map you had grabbed from the Welcome Center and the map app on your phone to try and figure out where you are. Eventually realizing that you were on the opposite side of the building, you exit the building through the door you had entered from and make a mad dash to the other side of the building. 

    You quickly open the first door you see and almost crash into someone. "Sorry about that." 

    <<link "Next">><<goto "Day 2 Interview 12">><</link>>

    "Hmm." The man in front of you squints up at you through his glasses. "Are you the detective?" 

    You quickly realize that this is Khanh Cao. "Yes, I'm Detective $lname." You pull out your badge to show him and he takes it to examine it. 

    Satisfied with what he sees, he passes it back to you and turns around to enter the building again. "You're late."

    You laugh awkwardly as you follow after him. "I'm afraid I'm not familiar with the campus, so finding my way over here was a bit tricky. My apologies, Professor Cao." 

    You're met with another disapproving hum. You sense that frivolities are not appreciated here.

    Cao leads you to his office, a space cluttered with so many books, spare metal parts, and loose pieces of paper that you can barely find a path to the unoccupied chair across the desk from where Cao sits down. He folds his hands on his desk and stares you down. "So, what did you want to talk to me about?"

    "What was your relationship with Archibald Watts?" 

    Khanh's face darkens. "A once-friend." 

    You raise an eyebrow. "Can you elaborate on that?" 

    Khanh sighs and shakes his head. His voice is terse, like thinking about Watts brings nothing but bad memories. "We were coworkers. We both worked as mechanics for the GMC dealership that used to be on Capitol. It's closed now. We got along well enough. Our kids were in the same grade, his twins and my daughter." Cao pauses for a moment. "After Sunny's body was found, I never spoke to him again."

    "Why?" 

    Khanh's face grows furious. "Why? Because the bastard killed her that's why! I know he did! That s-" Khanh's next words were cut off by a coughing fit. 

    You jump up to, well, you're not sure what, but Khanh waves at you to sit down. Hesitantly, you sit back down. His coughing eventually subsides, and he looks much more tired than he was earlier. He continues in a much quieter voice. "I don't know what deal he made with the devil to escape justice, but that man should not have walked free."

    "What makes you so sure?" 

    Cao stares you in the eyes, rage evident. "The bodies were in the cabinets he had been fixing. The poison that killed them was found in his house. There was no question about it." He pauses for a second, weighing his next words. "You should have seen him when little Delilah went missing. There was no emotion in those eyes, Detective. It's like he didn't care that she was gone." He shakes his head.

    Cao nods and smiles sadly. "Yes. She and my wife sewed these. Sunny got the idea from one of the girls in her class to put a pocket inside a scrunchie. Practically begged Hellen to help her make a set of her own. I think she hid mostly candies in those pockets, sneaky little girl."

    At 8:00PM, you stand outside Mark's house, knocking on the door. After a minute, the door opens to reveal Mark. "Hey $name, come on in." He stands aside to let you pass through the door and yells into the hallway. "$name's here!" He then turns back to you. "You doing alright?"

    You nod as you walk through the door. "Same as this morning. How are-" 
    
    You don't even have a chance to finish your sentence when you hear a pitter patter of small feet running. Suddenly a young girl tackles your legs. "Detective!" 

    You laugh as you try to keep your balance. "Hi Ashley." You've always thought it was a bit funny that Ashley Keeley addresses you as "Detective" instead of your name, especially since Mark was promoted to Detective before you were, but no one objected to the nickname and you personally found it endearing, so the nickname stuck. 

    Mark grabs Ashley and hoists her in his arms. "Careful ticklebug, you'll knock poor $name off $his feet." He nods for you to follow as he makes his way to the kitchen. You follow after him, nodding and expressing your surprise where appropriate while Ashley looks over her father's shoulder as she regales you with her exciting day at school.

    Your group quickly arrives in the kitchen where Mark puts Ashley down. "Go tell Papa that Dad's going to be in the backyard, okay?" 

    Ashley quickly nods and goes darting past you in search of her other father. 

    Mark grabs a cup and gestures to you with it. "Anything to drink?"

    "Sure, what do you have?" 

    "We've got water, coffee, tea, or juice." 

    "I'll take a $drink." 

    Mark nods and grabs you <<if $drink == "water">>a bottle of water from the fridge. <<elseif $drink == "coffee">>a can of coffee from the fridge. <<elseif $drink == "tea">>an Arizona iced tea from the fridge. 

    You raise your eyebrows as he holds it out to you. "This barely counts as tea, you know that right?" 

    He shrugs. "This is a coffee and juice household first and foremost."

    You decide that this isn't a hill worth dying on and drop the subject. <</if>> You murmur a quick thanks and take the drink. 
    
    Mark pours himself a glass of water and gestures for you to follow him through the back door to the backyard.

    The warm night air wraps around you when you walk out the door, though you know it'll start to get cold soon. The sun has set by now but the streetlamp in front of the house casts a bit of light into the backyard allowing you to see. The two of you sit in two of the three lawn chairs the Keeleys have setup outside. 

    Mark takes a sip of his water. "So, you wanted to talk about the Watts case?"

    "What do you mean by that?" 

    Mark sighs. "Well, Paul was best friends with the Watts twins and Mr. Cao's daughter. And that group of kids was the first to go missing. It was Delilah Watts first, one of the twins. Then Paul. Then Sunny Cao. After a few months, Adam Watts was the only one left. But Delilah, when she disappeared, I remember our family and the Caos were really worried. But Watts? He didn't do anything. Didn't show any sign of concern for his own daughter, didn't even put out Missing Person posters." Mark shakes his head, his mouth set in a grim line. "I heard that when they found the bodies that he didn't even react. Just said that the cabinets were empty the last he saw them."

    You raise your eyebrows. "Past midnight?" 

    Mark laughs. "As if we'd ever let her stay up that late. No, midnight I think I was probably asleep. Fred might have still been awake- he has a commission due soon so he's been working on it where he can- but I was done for the day."

It might be someone else who went in the house, saw the photos, and smashed the frames. You could be looking for someone with a longstanding grudge against Watts."

    "Paul?" 

    Mark smiles and nods. "Yeah. The ones with the pockets, right? Sunny Cao used to give these out to kids as tokens of friendship. I remember Paul begging me for something to give back to her the day she gave him one, so I gave him a coin or something. Wait, no, I gave him a small bag of my arcade tokens. I think those tokens were my allowance for the week, but it was that or my action figures. I think their whole crew each had a scrunchie from Sunny and a token from Paul."

    "Do you still have the scrunchie Paul had?" 

    Mark shakes his head, his smile falling from his face. "No. It was on his arm when he-" He stops and looks away. "He had it with him when he was found. The officers took it as evidence. We never got it back."

    At first you considered that there was a slim chance that Pottinger could possibly be involved, but an email to the organizer in charge of the meeting Pottinger was at that night confirmed that general meetings ended at midnight and that Pottinger hadn't left until 6AM the morning after. Since the location was about an hour away, unless she somehow left without an entire conference of police chiefs noticing, drove an hour to town and an hour back, and somehow was awake at 6AM, there was no way she could have pulled it off. 
    
    You know that Pottinger has a very strict sleep schedule and that keeping her awake past 1AM without a good reason usually results in someone getting written up, so the scenario you thought up makes no sense. You cross her off your list of possible suspects.

            <</if>>
            <<if $optional_testimony["markPhoto"]>> 
                Mark seems to think that someone with a strong grudge smashed the photo frames in the house. If that's the case then would he count as someone with a grudge? Does he have enough of a reason to set a house on fire?
            <</if>>
            <<if $optional_testimony["markAlibi"]>> 
                Mark says he was at home that night, but that could only be confirmed by Fred who you know wouldn't hesitate to cover for his husband.

        <</if>> 
    <</nobr>>

    <<nobr>>
        You know a car matching the one you saw Adam driving was seen near the house before the fire, but Adam was the one who reported the fire, so that makes sense. <<if $optional_testimony["adamAlibi"]>>Not to mention that Adam says he didn't see his dad at all that day. <</if>>
        <<if $optional_testimony["adamSmoke"]>>
            Adam said that the lighter belonged to his father, but the coroner reported that Watts wasn't a heavy smoker, so having an engraved lighter doesn't sound likely. If the lighter belonged to a smoker, wouldn't it be more likely to be Adam's? Or are you reaching? 
        <</if>>
        <<if $optional_testimony["markPhoto"] and $optional_testimony["adamPhoto"]>> 
            If what Mark said is true, that you should be looking for someone who has a strong reaction to whatever was in the photos on the wall. Adam had a pretty strong reaction when you mentioned the photos<<if $optional_testimony["adamLeave"]>>, strong enough to leave the station in a rush<</if>>, so there's a chance the person who broke the photos could be him.

        <<if $optional_testimony["adamScrun"] and $optional_testimony["markScrun"]>> 
            There's also the question of why Adam lied about never having seen the scrunchie before. If Mark is telling the truth, then he should have gotten one from Sunny Cao too. Even if he didn't, Delilah Watts should have gotten one. It could be that he doesn't remember being given one, but his reaction makes you think otherwise.

        <<if $optional_testimony["kcaoAlibi"]>>
            Cao's lack of an alibi <<if $optional_testimony["kcaoLeave"]>>and refusal to answer your questions after you pressed him <</if>>could be a sign of guilt. It's also possible he was just annoyed at you for being nosy. He seems to have a short temper for these sorts of things.
        <</if>>
        <<if $optional_testimony["markPhoto"]>> 
            Cao could have a reason to smash the frames if they had content that could make him mad enough. <<if $optional_testimony["kcaoCough"]>>Coupled with how just thinking too hard about Watts seems to make him mad enough to induce a coughing fit, that could fit. And that cough, could it have been because of smoke inhalation from running through the fire?<</if>>
        <</if>>
        <<if $optional_testimony["kcaoScrun"]>>
            Cao identified the scrunchie as one of the ones Sunny had. Is there a chance he left it behind as he was disposing of the body? <<if $optional_testimony["kcaoWants"]>>He definitely wanted it back, but you could chalk that up to it having sentimental value.<</if>>

    Mark, Adam, and Cao are all resentful towards Archibald Watts, especially since they're all related to the children who died twenty years ago. You reason that any of them would have the motive for murder. The thing is, anyone who was affected by the cabinet killings of '98 could have enough malice in their hearts to kill Watts, but there doesn't seem to be significant evidence pointing to any person outside of the three .

    A mixture of different emotions flash across Adam's face. You can see fear, grief, longing, and others that move too fast for you to catch them. Eventually, Adam closes his eyes and opens the door. "Come in. You'll, you'll want to sit down." He turns around and walks away without checking to see if you follow. 

    You walk into the house and shut the front door.

    Adam leads you into what you assume is the dining room and sits at the small circular table situated there. 

    You take the seat across from him. You push your phone over to Adam, the photo still displayed on the screen. In a slightly gentler tone, you repeat your question. "This is yours, isn't it?" 

    Adam nods. "Yeah, it is. I, uh, I dropped it at Spirit Cell." 

    You assume he means Lucy Lemon. "Why did you go there?" 

    Adam tears his eyes away from your phone to look you in the eye. When he speaks, it's in a whisper. "To hide the body."

    "Adam, you realize that you're confessing to a crime right now, right?" 

    Adam nods. "It's the end of the line for me, I guess. Nowhere left to run." His voice cracks slightly and you can hear him begin to sniffle. You see a tissue box sitting on a nearby counter and grab it to give to him. Adam takes the box with a thankful nod. "I guess I should give you the whole story, before, well. Before." 

    You nod for him to proceed.

    Adam takes a deep breath and lets it out before he begins speaking. "I wasn't lying when I said I was here for the memorial. I am. Visiting my dad was a side trip.

    "I wanted to see if my dad had changed at all. Maybe there was some small part of me that wished that my dad wasn't a murderer, that he truly, I don't know, had been innocent. I was telling the truth all those years ago, that I really didn't know anything about the deaths. All I knew was that my friends were disappearing one by one until I was left all alone. 

    "So I visited him, brought over dinner and everything. And the meal was, well, it was okay. Quiet. Tense. Everything I remember living in that house. And then I pulled out the bottle of wine I'd brought and the words started pouring out. I didn't realize how much of a lightweight my dad was.

    "I was holding out hope that maybe this was all a misunderstanding, but as I spoke to him, I realized that he was completely delusional. He kept going on about how he had cracked the code to eternal life and how the human soul could be used as a power source. I actually confronted him, about Delilah and why he never felt, I don't know, anything about her passing, but all he said was that her soul wasn't strong enough. I asked what he meant, and he looked me dead in the eyes and said-" 

    Adam pauses to blow his nose, then continues, voice shakier than it was before. "He grabbed my arms and said, 'I used her soul because she was the stronger of you two. If you had lived up to the name I gave you, I would have killed you instead.' "

    You suddenly recall Vera telling you about the seven Bibles. Adam, the chosen son of God. Delilah, the traitor who betrayed the last Judge of Israel. You silently wonder who had chosen the names of their children, Archibald or his wife? 
    
    Adam shakes his head frantically, as if trying to drive away some unseen spectre. After letting out a shuddering breath, he continues in a slightly steadier voice. "I think that's when I snapped. I grabbed the knife that was lying on the table and stabbed him in the gut. And I just, I just kept stabbing him. It's like I couldn't control myself. The knife just kept going. When I came to, I realized I was kneeling over a corpse, the bloody knife still in my hand. For a minute, I felt… I don't know, happy? Like everything was finally over? I'm still not sure honestly. 

    "And then the reality of what I'd done caught up to me and I started panicking. I dragged his body up the stairs and dumped it in the bathtub while I searched for towels and bedsheets to wrap it in. I couldn't find the extra bed sheets- they weren't where I remember them being, but that was twenty years ago- so I just took the ones off the bed and wrapped his body in them. When I came back to grab him, he looked like Bloody Mary, just soaking in a pool of blood. I drained the tub, bleached it as best as I could, wrapped his body in the bedsheets, and then dragged him out the door. 

    "I parked in the driveway, so it was pretty easy to just throw him in the backseat. I'm stronger than I look." Adam lets out a weak laugh. "Probably inherited that from him. Maybe. I remember him being strong, but maybe that's because I was a lot younger when I last saw him. He didn't look that strong when I saw him that day." Adam paused for a moment before saying in a much quieter voice, "He wasn't strong enough to stop me."

    Adam pauses, engrossed in his own memory, before he shakes himself back to reality and continues. "I went back in to bleach the rest of the house but I was so scared and the bleach was making the carpet a different color and... I needed a smoke. So I lit a cigarette and stood there in the bloody bedroom for a minute. And then I left the cigarette there. Still lit. Did the same in the kitchen, just left it by the stove. Turned the gas for the stove on. 

    "I realized then that, well, that I had a dead body in my car. And that I was covered in blood. You'd be surprised how much an old man can bleed. So I went back to my AirBnB, changed my clothes and headed over to Spirit- sorry, I still get the name wrong after all these years- to the Lucy Lemon. 

    "Security was surprisingly lax. Did you know that they still use key-locks for the back door? And they don't have any security guards. You'd think such a big place would, but I guess it was my lucky night. My initial plan was to dump the body in a back alley, figured it would make the news anyways the next day, but as I drove by the Lucy Lemon, something possessed me to stop and try. I was able to get in through the back door and into the main building. There was already an arcade machine cabinet just sitting on the stage. It was like fate."

    Adam's gaze slowly drifts to the window in the kitchen, hovering somewhere to your right. "So I put the body in the cabinet. Just like what he did to my sister and my friends and all those children twenty years ago. And then I left. I went back to the house, called the fire department, and, well, you know the rest, Detective."
    
    Adam shakes his head and returns his gaze to you. "I'm genuinely surprised I wasn't stopped on the road that night. It feels like something was helping me. But I guess my luck has run out, Detective. My dad always said I would run out of places to run away too."

    You sit there, motionless. It's a lot to take in. A full confession, straight from the horse's mouth. But there are some details that don't fit quite right with you. 

    "So how did you lose the scrunchie?"

    Adam shrugs. "The panels were lifted when I got there. When I hauled the body into the arcade cabinet, I think the scrunchie fell out of my pocket and slipped through the crack between the panel and the floor. When I went to go grab it, I stepped on the panel and pushed it into the ground by accident. I ran backstage and found a lever I thought might work but I, uh, I guess I was panicking too much because I broke it."

    "Where's the knife now?"

    Adam nods to the kitchen. "It's, uh, it's in the drawer. Nobody's come around looking yet so I haven't chucked it." 

    "What about-"

    Adam cuts you off. "Can you just get it over with?"

    You pause for a moment. "Sorry?"

    Adam holds out his hands in front of him, fists closed and wrists up. "Just arrest me already. You're obligated to by law or whatever and I just-" He closes his eyes. "I just want to get it over with."

    <<link "Arrest Adam.">><<goto "Epilogue A1 09b">><</link>>

    "No."

    Adam opens his eyes. "Huh?"

    You stand up and put your phone and notebook back in your pocket. "I said, 'no.' I am not arresting you. I am instead going to apologize for wasting your time on an interrogation you refused to comply with since you do not have a lawyer, and I am going to leave. You are going to find yourself a lawyer, and you are going to show that you had been on the road until right before the fire." You meet Adam's eyes. "And then after I agree that there's no way you could have set the fire, you are going to leave and go back to your life. You are going to carry on the memory of your sister and your friends, and I am going to conclude that any evidence that would point to the murderer was burnt in the fire." 

    Adam's eyes are comically wide, clearly taken aback by this turn of events. "Huh?" 

    You walk back to the front door. "I'm sorry for wasting your time, Adam. Please have your lawyer contact me as soon as possible. You can understand why we want to get the ball rolling on this." 

    Adam runs after you as you step outside of the house. "Wait!" 

    You stop and turn around. "Is there something wrong?" 

    Despite being a couple of years older than you, at that moment, Adam Watts looks like a lost child. "Why?" 

    You smile. "Because this city has seen enough death associated with Archibald Watts, and enough is enough. Have a good day, Adam." You turn around and make your way back to your car. As you pull away from the curb, you choose not to look at Adam kneeling on the ground, sobbing in relief.

    You nod and pull out your handcuffs. "You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court. You have the right to a lawyer. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you upon request. If you decide to answer questions now without a lawyer present, you have the right to stop answering at any time."

    As you recite Adam his Miranda rights, you shut the handcuffs around his wrists. His eyes are still shut tight, but you can see the tears leaking out and his quiet sobs. You listen closely and realize that in between sobs, Adam is chanting, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

    You don't talk about the Watts case with the people around you. Everyone asks how you knew, what the decisive evidence was, but to this day you're not sure. You usually chalk it up to a number of different components that just fit together in the right way, and that seems to satisfy the general public. 

    You've been in and out of court these past few months, testifying and doing your best not to meet the eyes of the people in the jury and the eyes of the person sitting in the defendant's seat.

    Adam never lifts his eyes from the defense's table. He's even skinnier than he was when you first met him, a shadow of his former self. You heard a rumor that he might switch his plea to "guilty" for a reduced sentence. You quietly think that it's because if the trial drags on any longer, he might just die. 

    Adam doesn't have any family at the trial. You don't know the details, but apparently after his mother's death when he was only two, his mother's side of the family never contacted them ever again. His father's side of the family never contacted them in the first place. Looking at Adam sitting there all alone, you imagine it must be quite lonely. 

    You just hope you did the right thing.

    "Yes, Captain. I'm afraid that because of insufficient evidence and a pool of people too wide to be properly investigated, that determining who killed Archibald Watts will not be possible." 

    Pottinger steadily holds your gaze as she closes the file and places it at her desk. "Is that what you plan to tell the press?"

"I'll probably change it slightly and say that as of now we do not have any leads, and that if concerned folk have anything to share that they should contact the tip line, but other than that? Yes.
